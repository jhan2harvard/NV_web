    <h2>Natural Ventilation Potential Map in Unites States</h2>

        <div style="padding: 10px 0px 0px 0px" >

    <p>The US is responsible for 21% of global CO2 emissions. Of that amount, 98% originates from energy consumption. Humans spend up to 80-90% of their lifetime indoors (Klepeis et al., 2001). It is therefore important to identify the parameters that influence indoor air quality (IAQ) and thus the comfort and health of occupants. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised increasing concern over indoor health as a broad range of potential pollutants and pathogens originating from both indoor and outdoor sources could affect the quality of air. Several studies indicated that the disease transmission indoors could be reduced by building-related factors, such as the increased outdoor air exchange rates and lower occupancy densities. Natural ventilation (NV) is an effective way to improve building energy efficiency, bringing fresh air indoors without the energy use from the HVAC operation and the cost of the filter placement. However, the uncertainty and complexity associated with controlling windows often prevents a broad application of NV. The result is that occupants often cannot control whether and how much window openings are utilized indoors. This research creates a new web-based software that will inform users of the NV potential of every location in the US.
